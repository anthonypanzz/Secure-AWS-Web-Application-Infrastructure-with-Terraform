# Secure AWS Web Application Infrastructure with Terraform

This project demonstrates how to design, deploy, and secure a production-grade web application on AWS using Terraform.
The primary focus is security-first cloud architecture, applying defense-in-depth principles across networking, identity, data, and access layers.

All infrastructure is provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure repeatability, auditability, and compliance.

Security-First Architecture Overview

This infrastructure is built around zero-trust and least-privilege principles:

Private-by-default networking

No direct SSH exposure

Secrets never hardcoded

Encrypted traffic end-to-end

Controlled IAM permissions

Auditable, version-controlled infrastructure

🧱 High-Level Architecture

Custom VPC with isolated public, application, and data subnet tiers

Application Load Balancer (ALB) with HTTPS enforced

Auto Scaling EC2 application servers in private subnets

RDS MySQL in private data subnets

Secrets Manager for credential storage

EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint (EICE) for secure access

ACM-managed TLS certificates

Route 53 DNS with ALB alias

SNS notifications for scaling events

Remote Terraform state with locking

🛠️ Technology Stack

Terraform

AWS (VPC, EC2, RDS, IAM, ALB, ACM, Route 53, SNS)

Secrets Manager

Linux / Bash

MySQL

🔍 Security-Focused Implementation Breakdown
1️⃣ Provider Configuration

Security Objective: Controlled AWS access and consistency

AWS provider scoped to region and profile

Provider version pinning to prevent breaking changes

Default resource tagging for ownership and auditing

2️⃣ Remote Backend (State Security)

Security Objective: Protect Terraform state

S3 backend for centralized state storage

DynamoDB table for state locking (prevents race conditions)

Prevents local state leaks and enables team collaboration

3️⃣ Network Segmentation (VPC)

Security Objective: Network isolation and blast-radius reduction

Custom VPC with DNS enabled

Multi-AZ architecture

Public subnets for internet-facing resources only

Private application subnets (no public IPs)

Private data subnets for databases

4️⃣ NAT Gateway

Security Objective: Controlled outbound access

NAT Gateway placed in public subnet

Private subnets route outbound traffic without inbound exposure

Prevents direct internet access to application and database tiers

5️⃣ Security Groups (Layered Firewalling)

Security Objective: Least-privilege network access

Dedicated security groups for:

ALB (HTTPS only)

Application servers

RDS database

Data migration server

EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint (EICE)

Explicit inbound and outbound rules

No wide-open 0.0.0.0/0 access to private resources

6️⃣ Secure Instance Access (EICE)

Security Objective: Eliminate bastion hosts and exposed SSH

EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint deployed in private subnet

SSH access without public IPs

Access controlled via IAM and security groups

7️⃣ Secrets Management

Security Objective: Protect sensitive credentials

Database credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager

Terraform references secrets using data sources

JSON secrets parsed securely using jsondecode()

No plaintext secrets in code or state files

8️⃣ RDS (MySQL)

Security Objective: Secure data storage

RDS deployed in private data subnets

Credentials sourced from Secrets Manager

Security group restricts access to application layer only

Managed backups and patching

9️⃣ IAM Roles & Instance Profiles

Security Objective: Least-privilege access control

IAM role scoped to EC2 service

Explicit trust policy

S3 access via managed policy

No static credentials on EC2 instances

🔟 TLS & Certificate Management (ACM)

Security Objective: Encrypt data in transit

ACM-provisioned SSL/TLS certificates

DNS validation via Route 53

Automated certificate validation using for_each

1️⃣1️⃣ Application Load Balancer

Security Objective: Secure traffic entry point

Public ALB as the only internet-facing component

HTTP redirected to HTTPS

TLS termination at ALB

Health checks for availability and resilience

1️⃣2️⃣ DNS Security (Route 53)

Security Objective: Controlled traffic routing

Alias A record pointing directly to ALB

No IP exposure

1️⃣3️⃣ SNS Notifications

Security Objective: Operational awareness

SNS topic for Auto Scaling events

Email notifications for scaling activity

1️⃣4️⃣ Auto Scaling Group

Security Objective: Resilience and availability

EC2 instances launched in private subnets

Immutable infrastructure via launch templates

User data scripts injected securely using templatefile()

ALB target group integration

1️⃣5️⃣ Secure Data Migration

Security Objective: Controlled data access

Dedicated EC2 migration server

Short-lived access pattern

Migration scripts parameterized securely

Explicit dependency on RDS readiness

1️⃣6️⃣ Outputs

Security Objective: Controlled information exposure

Outputs limited to non-sensitive metadata

No secrets exposed

Includes ALB DNS and application URL

🚀 Deployment & Validation
terraform fmt
